            <p>Your Username refers to the unique name you use on the Envato Market. This is the username associated with
                your
                account and items on platforms like ThemeForest, CodeCanyon, and others in the Envato ecosystem. Enter your

        <Details summary="What is the Token?">
            <p>
                The Token is a unique API key that allows the app to securely access your Envato sales and earnings data. To
                generate a token, you need to create an application on the <a href="https://build.envato.com/"
                                                                              rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="font-medium text-blue-600 underline dark:text-blue-500 hover:no-underline">Envato
                API platform</a>. Once your app is created, you
                will receive a token that you can add here to enable data tracking. Make sure to grant the necessary
                permissions
                when generating the token for full access to your sales information. </p>
